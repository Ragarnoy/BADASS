# What is BGP ?

BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is an inter-AS routing protocol that facilitates the exchange of network reachability information between BGP systems. From this information, BGP can direct packets along the most efficient routes to their target autonomous systems.

Networks within an autonomous system communicate routing information to each other using one or more interior gateway protocols. In contrast, communications between autonomous systems rely on a single exterior gateway protocol -- Border Gateway Protocol -- which makes it possible to share routing information and efficiently route data packets between autonomous systems. BGP can then use this information to build a forwarding topology that directs packets along the best routes, while avoiding network loops.
