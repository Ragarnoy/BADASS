# What is a MAC Address ?

A `MAC` (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to a NIC (Network Interface Card). It is a 48-bit number that is usually displayed in hexadecimal format.  
A MAC address is composed of 6 bytes, the first 3 being the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) and the last 3 being the NIC identifier. This means that there can theorically be 2^48 = 281,474,976,710,656 unique MAC addresses, and 2^24 = 16,777,216 unique NIC identifiers per OUI.
